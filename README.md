# template literals (template strings)
You can add strings toget with  backticks ($``), you can combine strings in a single backtick. This will wrtie out a little easier.<br>
It will also make substitutions more readable <br>
ex let a = 1 b = 2 console.log(`This will equal ${a+b}.`)<br>
You can do this with nesting templates. By creating condition of true, return templated literal. Basically it becomes a placeholder for a true statment <br>
Tagged templates more advanced form. 
# template literals again
you can use them for string substitution.
you can put strings inside of functions!
You can use them with method calls!
You can use them with desugars. 
With expressions!<br>
let name = `Ryan`;

console.log(`Hi my name is ${name}`);<br>
it will read 'Hi my name is Ryan';

with complex objects
you access objects in an array with backtick${this.property}backtick.

# For Each
My take away was that I was doing forEach incorrectly. I need to start using the arrow function which will most likely make my functions work.
